HOPEBot is a Bluetooth-controlled robot capable of moving fast and over rough terrains, withstanding forces and has inverted operation and live feedback capabilities. Also, a version that can be controlled using a wireless game controller is also shown.

The robot is built like a tank, with custom-made tank wheels of my own design. These wheels allow the robot to move over rough terrain easily. Moreover, they provide inverted operation capability to the robot, meaning that the robot can still operate normally if it is accidentally flipped over.

This robot will especially come in handy for rescue operations where humans cannot go. It can navigate those areas and provide live feedback to the rescuers. Its sturdy build and inverted operation will help it in its task.

At the core of the robot is an Arduino microcontroller board that controls all its functions. The robot is built like a tank, with custom-made tank wheels of our own design. The four wheel are powered by four DC gear motors, which are controlled by the microcontroller. The robot is controlled wirelessly using Bluetooth technology using an Android device with the help of an app (another version that can be controlled using a wireless game controller is also shown). Also, another android phone has been attached to the front of the robot, whose camera will provide live feedback to a PC or to the android device controlling the robot. The camera’s functionality can also be controlled wirelessly. Also, a powerful flashlight is attached to the front of the robot, which will provide better view in dark conditions. The whole robot is powered by a 3-cell LiPo battery of 11.1 V and 2200 mAh rating.

# HOPEBot has three major aspects:

1. It’s tank-like wheels and sturdy build allow the robot to move over rough terrain easily. Moreover, they provide inverted operation capability to the robot, meaning that the robot can still operate normally if it is accidentally flipped over. Also, the tank-like wheels have been made using readily-available materials and are extremely cheap.
2. It can be controlled wirelessly from distance, using either an Android phone or any other wireless remote.
3. It can provide live video feedback of the areas under surveillance to a central control center. Also, a powerful flashlight is present for use in dark conditions.
